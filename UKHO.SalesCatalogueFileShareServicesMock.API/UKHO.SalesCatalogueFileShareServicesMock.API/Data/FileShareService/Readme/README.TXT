SECTION 1 - IMPORTANT GENERAL INFORMATION
---------------------------------------

ISOLATED DANGER MAY NOT DISPLAY AS EXPECTED
-------------------------------------------
UKHO has been made aware of a safety issue where the Isolated Danger symbol is not displaying as expected on some ECDIS in certain rare circumstances. 

This issue results from the way some ECDIS are processing some ENC updates. It will be resolved by issuing a New Edition of the affected ENCs and software upgrades to affected ECDIS. ENC Producers and Regional ENC Coordination Centres have been made aware of the issue and the affected ENCs will be updated by New Edition as soon as possible. 

The display issue does not affect the detection of isolated dangers in route checks or monitoring/anti-grounding checks. The ECDIS Pick Report is able to access the information about the hazard as normal.
The correct symbol will display if the ECDIS is in display mode ‘ALL OTHER’.

Until the measures above have taken effect, mariners should continue to respond to alerts and indications as normal but be aware that, in rare situations, an Isolated Danger symbol may not be showing on the display as would have been expected. If the yellow hazard highlight box is observed without a symbol, a manual update can be applied to insert the feature.



DELAYS TO UPDATING INFORMATION DUE TO COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS) PANDEMIC 
--------------------------------------- 

UKHO continues to receive information about the impact of COVID-19 measures on navigational information from Hydrographic Offices around the world. To inform you about how ADMIRALTY Products and Services are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, UKHO is publishes a downloadable PDF document at www.admiralty.co.uk/news/all-news/ukho-response-to-covid-19.

UKHO will keep the document updated on the web site as new information becomes available and maintain communication via ADMIRALTY Chart Agents for safety related information or significant product impacts.  


-----------------

NUMBER OF PERMITTED INSTALLATIONS

The End User Licence Agreement (EULA) governing the use of AVCS data permits its installation on a maximum of 5 workstations on any licensed vessel.  It further recognises that some parts of the data may be installed on more or fewer workstations.  ENCs with the following producer codes may be installed on the maximum number of workstations indicated:

---------------------

ENC UPDATE STATUS

The latest update status of every ENC in AVCS is listed in the file ENC-Update-List.csv located in the INFO folder on this disc.  The file lists the edition number and update numbers and dates for each ENC, correct in the week of publication.  The most recent 4 weeks of status files can be found in the ADMIRALTY Vector Chart Service updates section of the UKHO website at admiralty.co.uk/avcs.

---------------------

TEMPORARY INFORMATION IN ENCs

The latest confirmed status of Temporary and Preliminary information (T&P) information in the ENCs that are available in AVCS is shown in the ENC-T&P-NM-Status.pdf file in the INFO folder of the exchange set and at: admiralty.co.uk/ENC-TP-NMs. Note that ADMIRALTY T&P Notices to Mariners are only issued for ADMIRALTY paper charts and therefore may not be available for all ENC coverage.

ADMIRALTY Information Overlay (AIO) shows ADMIRALTY paper T&Ps where they are not already included in the ENCs. Most countries now include temporary information in their ENCs.

Further guidance can be found in the INFO folder on AIO discs.

---------------------

GEOGRAPHICAL NAMES - UK GOVERNMENT POLICY

Some of the chart data in this product have been compiled by other hydrographic offices. In accordance with principles adopted by the International Hydrographic Organization, the UKHO has not, without the permission of the data producer, made any amendments to such data. Consequently, some of the names used to depict geographical features do not reflect the policy of the United Kingdom in relation to the naming of such features. Where this is the case, it in no way implies that the United Kingdom accepts that the geographical names used are appropriate, or that it approves of their use.
 
---------------------

AVCS ONLINE UPDATING SERVICE (AVCS OUS)

Email calls to AVCS OUS will receive an auto-response that asks the customer to resubmit their data request online by http. The email service for AVCS OUS was withdrawn at the end of February 2019 due to technology infrastructure changes at UKHO.
Please contact your ADMIRALTY Chart Agent if support is required for use of the http service.

---------------------

AVCS CD SERVICE

Because of the limit to data volume that can be fitted onto a disc, from WK32/20 AVCS Base and Update ISO files will no longer be available to download from the ADMIRALTY FTP site for burning to disc. For customers who prefer to update their ECDIS with base and update exchange sets,.zip files may be downloaded from the FTP site to load into ECDIS as normal. AVCS DVDs ISO files are not affected.

For details on the ADMIRALTY FTP site, visit the Updates tab at admiralty.co.uk/AVCS

---------------------


INTERIM CATEGORY OF ZONE OF CONFIDENCE IN DATA (CATZOC) VALUES

The boundaries between Quality of Data (M_QUAL) areas with different CATZOC values for some ENCs have been taken from the Source Diagram (SD) on the equivalent paper chart and they should therefore be considered to be approximate.

For these M_QUAL areas, the CATZOC values are based on the simplified summary provided in the SDD and therefore represent the lowest categorisation assigned to any survey in each defined group of surveys.

The simplification means that it has not been possible to identify minor gaps within survey coverage and mariners should be aware that such gaps (where lower quality survey data has been used in the compilation of the chart) may exist.

These assessments are based on original survey accuracies and on expectations of good practice by relevant survey authorities. Some evaluations may require downgrading once detailed survey information has been examined.

---------------------

OVERLAPPING ENCS IN THE SAME USAGE BAND

Some data providers issue ENCs which contain overlapping data coverage, both internally and with adjoining nation’s coverage. This may make them difficult to use in certain ECDIS systems which default to displaying both overlapping cells. Caution should therefore be exercised when using such overlapping data. Mariners should be aware that there will be a possibility that items of significance may be present only in one data set within an area of overlap. They should therefore take care to examine both data sets when planning a voyage through such an area.

AU (Australia), PG (Papua New Guinea) and SB (Solomon Islands) ENC (published by AHO) - Updated 04 Feb 2021

Australian Hydrographic Office (AHO) publishes AU, PG and SB ENCs covering Australian, Australian Antarctic Territory, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands waters.

GUIDANCE ON ECDIS FOR SHIPS CALLING AT AUSTRALIAN PORTS – 9 April 2020 

When entering Australian Ports please be reminded of the AMSA Marine Notice 7/2017 (https://www.amsa.gov.au/vessels-operators/regulations-and-standards-vessels/marine-notices) which highlights areas relevant to the safe and proper operation of ECDIS for ships visiting Australian ports and provides information on AMSA's expectations for ECDIS compliance during Port State Control (PSC) inspections.  

Ships found not complying with AMSA Marine Notice 7/2017 may be detained. 

AMSA are concerned with software quality assurance in ECDIS and detection of operating anomalies using the ECDIS Data Presentation and Performance Check dataset.  Other areas of interest include chart carriage requirements, mode of ECDIS operation and ECDIS training requirements.  Specifically PSC inspectors will take account of: 

* appropriate declaration of ECDIS equipment in the Record of Equipment - Safety Equipment Certificate 
* listing of ECDIS as critical equipment in the Safety Management System (SMS) 
* documented procedures and instructions for use of ECDIS are included in the SMS and that they are understood by all officers responsible for navigation 
* ECDIS type approval certificate, confirming compliance with relevant IMO performance standard and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) test standard 
* ECDIS software is maintained to the latest applicable IHO standards 
* use of latest edition official ENCs, updated and corrected to the latest available updates and notices to mariners 
* adequate independent back-up arrangements (as detailed on the Record of Equipment), ensuring safe navigation for the remainder of the voyage in the event of an ECDIS failure 
* approved ECDIS generic and familiarisation training has been undertaken by the master and officers in charge of navigation 
* conformance and alignment with input from sensors (e.g. heading, speed and rate of turn) and presentation of such information on the ECDIS display 
* evidence of periodic tests and checks of the ECDIS carried out in accordance with the SMS and the manufacturer's requirements 
* demonstration of operational competency by the ship's navigating officers (e.g. safety checking of a voyage plan) 
* ECDIS settings are appropriate to the ship's dimensions and area of operations (e.g. cross track error, anti-grounding cone, safety depth and contour). 

DATA APPEARANCE - Updated 26 Jan 2021

Australian published ENCS contain either the same or greater levels of detail than the corresponding paper chart.  In particular ENCs may contain 1-metre contours that are not available in the paper chart.  This will enable the full benefits of ECDIS and particularly its safety depth alarm function to be used most effectively.  
The geographical limits of individual ENCs are likely to differ from the geographical limits of corresponding paper charts.  To interpret geographical locations of AHO published ENC from their file numbers, see the Guide to the AHO’s ENC Numbering System fact sheet at https://www.hydro.gov.au/factsheets/factsheets.htm

UPDATES - Updated 9 April 2020 

Updates for AU, PG and SB ENCs published by the Australian Hydrographic Office are issued weekly. They include all Permanent, Temporary and Preliminary Updates.  For updates to Australian Hydrographic Publications (nautical publications), and any Paper Nautical Charts used as a backup to ECDIS, mariners should consult the fortnightly Australian Notices to Mariners available via the AHO website at www.hydro.gov.au. 

IMPORTANT NOTICE - Updated 9 April 2020 

All AU, PG and SB ENCs published by the Australian Hydrographic Office include all significant hydrographic information assessed as suitable for use (including data which may be of known or unknown quality) at date of compilation.  Significant changes are promulgated via ENC Update or ENC New Edition as appropriate, as well as by Australian Notices to Mariners.   All reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information, including third party information, incorporated in this product.   The AHO regards third parties from which it receives information as reliable, however the AHO cannot verify all such information and errors may therefore exist.   Where possible, indications regarding the reliability of information are noted or symbolised in the product.   Users should familiarise themselves with the meaning of any notes or symbols, including those described in AHP20 Mariners Handbook for Australian Waters.   The AHO does not accept liability for errors in third party information or the inappropriate use of Australian published ENCs.

Importance notice about the Saimaa deep-water route

The maximum authorised draught in the Saimaa deep-water route is 4.35m. According to IHO standard S-57, which determines the data content and technical implementation of ENC cells, the depth of a channel can be expressed with one decimal digit only. Therefore ENC cells show the maximum authorised draught of the route as 4.3m although the actual draught is 4.35m.
For further information on the Saimaa area channels and their depths please contact the Finnish Transport Agency.

No part of this product may be reproduced either in whole or in part, except as specifically required by the host system, without the prior permission of the copyright holders. The product may not be sold, hired, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise without the prior permission of the copyright holders. Applications for the copyright holders' permission to reproduce any part of the product should be directed in the first instance to the Licensing Manager, UK Hydrographic Office, Taunton, Somerset TA1 2DN, United Kingdom.

While the UKHO has made all reasonable efforts to ensure the ENC data supplied is accurate, it may not always be complete, up to date or positioned to modern surveying standards and therefore no warranty can be given as to its accuracy. The mariner must be the final judge of the reliance placed on the information given, bearing in mind the particular circumstances, the needs of safe and prudent navigation, local pilotage guidance and available navigational aids.

Updates for UKHO ENCs are issued weekly. See www.admiralty.co.uk.

NON-WGS84 COMPATIBLE DATUMS

A number of GB cells are derived from charts that cannot accurately be referred to WGS84 Datum. Mariners are warned that these differences MAY BE SIGNIFICANT TO NAVIGATION and are therefore advised to confirm GPS positions shown in the chart display using alternative navigational techniques particularly when closing the shore or navigating in the vicinity of dangers.
Such cells contain a warning encoded as the name of a Sea Area feature covering the cell: "This chart cannot be accurately referenced to WGS84 Datum; see caution message". They are intended for use with this warning continuously displayed and should not be used otherwise.

CATEGORY OF ZONE OF CONFIDENCE IN DATA (CATZOC) VALUES:
The boundaries between Quality of Data (M_QUAL) areas with different CATZOC values for certain cells have been taken from the Source Diagram (SD) on the equivalent paper chart and are therefore approximate. 

For these M_QUAL areas, the CATZOC values are based on the simplified summary provided in the SD and therefore represent the lowest categorisation assigned to any survey in each defined group of surveys.
The degree of simplification also means that it has not been possible to identify minor gaps within survey coverage and mariners should be aware that such gaps (where lower quality survey data has been used in the compilation of the chart) may exist. 

Some ENCs are based on small scale planning charts that do not have a Source Diagram. The UKHO has adopted a policy of allocating a CATZOC value of ‘D’ to all Quality of Data (M_QUAL) areas of such charts though it recognizes that many of these areas are based on higher quality data.

All interim CATZOC values will be replaced by definitive ones in due course.

---------------------

IT (Italy) - Added 18 Jun 2020

GENERAL WARNING - Only official ENCs and nautical publications should be used, provided by authorized distributors, as listed in the Italian HO website. The IIM is not responsible for Nautical Charts, Electronic Charts and Publications that have not been acquired at or through its authorized distribution channels. 
All Italian charts and ENCs have to be used in conjunction with other Italian Nautical Publications, such as Introduction to Italian Sailing Directions (I.I. 3146), Italian Sailing Directions (I.I. 3201 - 3208, 8 volumes), Italian List of Lights and Fog Signals (I.I. 3134), List of Radio signals (I.I. 3128 and I.I. 3130) and other IIM publications.
Attention is drawn to the statement in A.N. n° 16 of the Introduction to Italian Sailing Directions (I.I. 3146) concerning the use of navigational information provided by the IIM. This includes the following caution which applies to all charts, paper and electronic: "Finally, mariners must never forget that a nautical chart can never be perfectly coincident with reality, being only one of its possible representations; they must always consider the possible presence of particular dangers, prescriptions and regulations, especially near the coast, and therefore consult all the relevant Nautical Documentation as well as general and local regulations.
An incorrect or improper use of Nautical Documentation does not guarantee the adequate and necessary levels of safety, especially when sailing near the coast".

COPYRIGHT - All the Italian cells included in the present exchange set are Official Nautical Charts as per Italian Law 2.2.1960. They include information protected by Copyright. Reproduction is prohibited without the Istituto Idrografico della Marina’s explicit consent.

UPDATES - Updates for IT ENCs are generally issued every two weeks. Updates are issued for all Permanent Chart-Correcting and Preliminary Notices to Mariners. Mariners should consult the Italian Notices to Mariners (pdf format) at http://www.marina.difesa.it/conosciamoci/organizzazione/comandienti/scientifici/idrografico/Pagine/home.aspx

ENC DATUMS - A number of IT cells are derived from paper charts that cannot accurately be referred to WGS84 Datum, and refer to a local datum (Bessel, Rome 1940) or a European Datum (1950). Positions obtained from Global Navigation Satellite Systems, such as GPS, are normally referred to WGS84 Datum. The differences between satellite-derived positions and positions on these cells cannot be accurately determined; the estimated differences are detailed in the HORDAT & SHIPAM attributes of M_HOPA. Old cells contain a "Chart Accuracy" Caution warning Mariners about accuracy issues due to very old data or different Datum; these can be significant particularly when closing the shore or navigating in the vicinity of dangers. In these cells any case, the quality of data specified in the M_QUAL parameters is set considering also this kind of issues.

M_QUAL - The boundaries between Quality of Data (M_QUAL) areas with different CATZOC values for certain cells have been taken from the Source Data Diagram (SDD) on the equivalent paper chart and they should therefore be considered as approximate. This may be reported in a specific Caution.

---------------------

KR (Republic of Korea)

Korea has requested that ENC KR679A95 (Eastern Part of Mukho Hang) be removed from sale. Korea have advised that this ENC is still valid for use by existing holders and will continue to be updated until the end of 2021, when all licences will have expired.

This ENC is therefore no longer available to order or renew. It will remain in the PRODUCTS.TXT file and therefore the polygon limits may display on ECDIS, even though it cannot be purchased. To remain compliant, vessels should routinely check their planned routes to make sure that they have purchased all other ENCs under their track.

US (United States of America) - Added 18 Jun 2020

The NOAA electronic navigational chart (NOAA ENC®) files that may be downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are official products. Official ENCs are suitable for navigation under the following regulations and policies, and in the following circumstances:

1. On May 2, 2001, the United States Coast Guard amended the chart carriage regulations to permit government vessels to use electronic charting and navigation systems in lieu of paper charts.

2. On August 15, 2002, the United States Coast Guard issued a statement of policy to bring its regulations into agreement with SOLAS Chapter V (as amended by the changes taking effect July 1, 2002). The policy statement said that, if a ship has an approved ECDIS installed according to SOLAS, Chapter V, the ECDIS will be considered as meeting the ship's nautical chart carriage regulations. The ships that are affected are:

a. U.S.-flagged ships of 150 or more gross tons that engage on international voyages.

b. U.S.-flagged ships certificated solely for service on the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.

c. Foreign-flag ships to which SOLAS, Chapter V, applies that are operating on the navigable waters of the United States. 

This policy is not applicable to U.S.-flag ships engaged only on domestic voyages. These ships must continue to comply with existing navigation equipment requirements until the chart carriage regulations are formally amended.

The NOAA ENC® files available from this site are updated for Notices to Mariners on at least a monthly basis. Users are encouraged to check the site frequently and download the latest versions of the files. Updates are currently available as incremental updates (also called ENC Revision or "ER" files).

Copying, reproduction of the NOAA ENC®s to any other server or location for further reproduction or redistribution is discouraged unless the following guidelines are followed: 1) the NOAA ENC®s and supplementary files including the CATALOG.031 and README.TXT are included in their entirety, 2) this disclaimer is displayed to and accepted by anyone who accesses the NOAA ENC®s, and 3) a reference to this Web site is included so that anyone accessing the NOAA ENC®s is advised of where they originated. 

If these NOAA ENC®s are incorporated into any other product in a form other than as provided by NOAA, the producer of that product assumes full liability and must adhere to conditions 2 and 3 described in the paragraph above concerning copying or reproduction.

1U (Taiwan)

In addition to official GB ENCs, extra information in the form of datasets issued by Taiwan, has been included in AVCS to assist with safe navigation and for use entirely at the vessel's risk. For vessels navigating in coastal waters or entering ports of Taiwan, local authorities may require this data to be used on ECDIS to meet their chart carriage requirements.

Because the producer is not listed as official by the International Hydrographic Office, the Taiwan datasets may show up in ECDIS displays as "non-ENC" or "unofficial". For compliance purposes the local authorities have stated that the indication can be ignored.
