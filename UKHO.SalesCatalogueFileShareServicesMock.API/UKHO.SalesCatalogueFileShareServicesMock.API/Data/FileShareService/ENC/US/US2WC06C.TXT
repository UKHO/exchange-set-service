NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES NOTE
National Marine Sanctuaries are protected areas, administered by NOAA,
which contain abundant and diverse natural resources such as marine
mammals, seabirds, fishes and tidepool invertebrates.  These areas are
particularly sensitive to environmental damage such as spills of oil and
other hazardous materials, discharges, and groundings.  Exercise
particular caution and follow applicable Sanctuary regulations when
transiting these areas to avoid environmental impacts.  A full description
of Sanctuary regulations may be found in 15 CFR Part 922 and in Coast
Pilot.
