AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Wash., and
the 11th Coast Guard District in Long Beach, California or
at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers
in San Francisco, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle,
Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOTE S
Regulations for Ocean Dumping Sites are contained in 40 CFR, Parts 220-228.
Additional information concerning the regulations and requirements for use of the
sites may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). See
U.S. Coast Pilots appendix for addresses of EPA offices.  Dumping subsequent to
the survey dates may have reduced the depths shown.


NOTE E
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Services (VTS) system in the San Francisco Bay and su-
rounding areas. Vessel operating procedures and designated
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners
should consult these sources for applicable rules and
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required,
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to
facilitate advance vessel traffic management within the
VTS area.

The U.S. Coast Guard operates a vessel Traffic Service
Offshore Vessel Movement Reporting System Covering the
seaward approaches to San Francisco Bay. Vessels are
requested to monitor VTSSF on Channel 12 at 15 and 45
minutes past each hour for broadcast reports of known
shipping traffic in the area.


CAUTION - VESSEL TRANSITING NOTE
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 3 for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


TIDAL INFORMATION
No tidal observations are available for the area covered by this chart.
