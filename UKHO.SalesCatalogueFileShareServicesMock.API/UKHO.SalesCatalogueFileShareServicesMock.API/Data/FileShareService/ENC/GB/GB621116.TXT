1. As a consequence of Hurricane Matthew which occurred during October 2016, depths, coastline and sea levels may have changed throughout the region (19° 04'.0N., 73° 38'.0W.). Wrecks and obstructions may have been displaced. Tidal predictions may be unreliable and aids to navigation may have been damaged, destroyed or be out of position. Mariners should expect considerable change and seek local knowledge when making for ports or seeking refuge.

2. Mariners are advised to navigate with extreme caution in the area.
