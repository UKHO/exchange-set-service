Over a specific period (see Notice to Mariners) the area
will be affected by military practices. Firing practices
will be performed by day and night if the shooting range
is clear. The shipping routes crossing the area
(Kiel-Flensburg route, Kiel-Baltic Sea route) are always
safe. The region will remain open for navigation.
During the firing practices, the Federal German Navy vessels
will show the signal NE 4 in accordance with the International 
Code of Signals. During darkness the towing tug will fire white
star signals and light up the target in dangerous encounter
situations. Vessels participating in the firing practices will
show only the lights and shapes required by COLREG and the
Traffic Regulations for Navigable Waterways.
