MAINTAINED DEPTHS
Soundings followed by an "m" are depths below Chart Datum,
which are intended to be maintained. It has to be anticipated
that they are not present everywhere.
These depths are liable to change due to silting. Particular
caution is recommended in waters outside the line of buoys
and in bank slope areas.
